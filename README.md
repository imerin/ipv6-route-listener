# 🧭 Route Listener for ICMPv6 RAs (Thread Border Routers)

This project listens for IPv6 Router Advertisements (RAs) from Thread Border Routers and automatically configures ULA prefixes and routes on the host system. It's specifically designed for environments like Synology DSM where the kernel is missing support for processing IPv6 route advertisements for Matter/Thread subnets.

## 🎯 Purpose

This tool was created to solve a specific problem when running Home Assistant on a Synology NAS:

1. The Synology DSM kernel is missing the `CONFIG_IPV6_ROUTE_INFO` kernel option
2. This prevents the system from automatically processing IPv6 Router Advertisements for subnets
3. Matter/Thread devices use these subnets for communication
4. Without proper routing, Home Assistant cannot communicate with Matter devices

This project provides a workaround by:
- Listening for ICMPv6 Router Advertisements
- Extracting ULA prefixes and routes
- Manually configuring these routes in the kernel using the `ip` command

## 🚀 Quick Start (with Docker)

1. **Clone this repo:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git
    cd route-listener
    ```

2. **Build and run the Docker container:**

    ```bash
    # Use default interface (eth0)
    ./run.sh

    # Or specify a custom interface
    ./run.sh -i wlan0

    # Enable logging of ignored routes
    ./run.sh --log-ignored
    ```

## 🐍 Local Development

If you're not using Docker:

1. **Install Poetry:**

    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

3. **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    # Use default interface (eth0)
    poetry run python -m route_listener.main

    # Or specify a custom interface
    poetry run python -m route_listener.main -i wlan0

    # Enable logging of ignored routes
    poetry run python -m route_listener.main --log-ignored
    ```

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Route Detection:**
   - Listens for ICMPv6 Router Advertisements on the specified network interface
   - Extracts ULA prefixes and routes from the advertisements
   - Each route is processed only once (subsequent advertisements for the same route are ignored)

2. **Route Filtering:**
   - Only ULA prefixes (starting with 'fd') are configured
   - Non-ULA prefixes are ignored by default
   - You can enable logging of ignored routes with the `--log-ignored` option
   - **Why only ULA prefixes?** Matter/Thread devices use ULA (Unique Local Address) prefixes for their internal communication. These prefixes are guaranteed to be unique and are not routable on the public internet, making them ideal for local network communication. By filtering for only ULA prefixes, we ensure we're only configuring routes that are relevant for Matter/Thread device communication.

3. **Route Configuration:**
   - When a new ULA route is detected, an external script (`thread-route.sh`) is called
   - The script uses the `ip` command to add the route to the kernel
   - Existing routes with the same prefix are removed before adding the new one

4. **Interface Configuration:**
   - By default, the script listens on the `eth0` interface
   - You can specify a different interface using the `-i` option
   - The script will abort if the specified interface doesn't exist

## 📜 History

This project was inspired by the discussion in the Home Assistant community about running Matter/Thread devices on a Synology NAS. The Synology DSM kernel is missing the `CONFIG_IPV6_ROUTE_INFO` kernel option, which prevents it from automatically processing IPv6 Router Advertisements for subnets that Matter devices use for communication.

This tool provides a workaround by manually configuring the routes based on the Router Advertisements, allowing Home Assistant to communicate with Matter devices on the Synology NAS.
